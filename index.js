/* The major difference btw, in fact a method is just a function.
    The only difference is in the way each is invoked.

    So a function:

*/

    const greet = () => "Hello Lora";

    let resultOne = greet();
     console.log(resultOne); 


/* Notice, we just called the function line 10 by putting a simple
parenthesis after the function's name?


In the case of methods, we often have a dot, followed by a command.

Something like greet.toUpperCase()
